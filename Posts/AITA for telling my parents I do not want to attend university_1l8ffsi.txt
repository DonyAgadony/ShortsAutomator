AITA for telling my parents I do not want to attend university
I’m 16M, live in Canada with immigrant parents (41F, 55M) who’ve always dreamed of me becoming a doctor. Typical story: get good grades, go to a top university, become successful. I get why they want that for me, but I’m struggling in school—even though I study hard, I can’t get my grades up, especially in chemistry and biology. I’m more interested in math. I’ve realized I don’t want to be a doctor.. The process is long, stressful, and not for me.. Instead, I want to become an electrician. There’s good money, high demand, and solid job security, and I’d eventually like to open my own business in a bigger city. Plus, I could start earlier through a co-op program in high school, but it means switching out of my current courses (biology, chemistry, physics).  When I told my parents, my mom reacted strongly and called trades jobs something "losers" do.. My dad was more open to it, but still wants me to stay in my current classes “just in case.” My mom now says if I don’t get 95%+ in science this year (I currently have 60%) she’ll punish me and keep me home all summer.. I feel like I'm being forced into a path that I'm not interested in, and I'm tired of not being heard.

AITA for wanting to take a different path?

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses, I'm glad that most people are supportive. Also, my mom has never been the type of person to care about anything anyone has to say, so I’m positive that she isn’t trying to secure bragging rights or feels the desire to say “my son, the doctor”.

Also, we’re immigrants from the Middle East (Palestinian to be exact), not South Asia.

My dad is an accomplished dentist who owns a dental practice and there are many doctors in my family and others were studying to become doctors..
